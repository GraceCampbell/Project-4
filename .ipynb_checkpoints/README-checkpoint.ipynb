    "# Client Project: Estimating Economic Impact of Hurricanes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assess the economic impact of hurricanes using ARIMA time series modeling**\n",
    "> For this project, we decided to look at Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Rita and how they affected regions in Texas to carry out our analysis\n",

    "## Methodology\n",
    "> 1. Gather the data\n",
    "> 2. Explore/analyze the data\n",
    "> 3. Model the data\n",
    "> 4. Make conclusions/give recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "> ### 1. Gather the Data\n",
    "> - **US Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)**:\n",
    ">   - Gross Domestic Product, Population, Personal Income (County Level - Annual)\n",
    "> - **US Department of Labor**:  \n",
    ">   - Unemployment Insurance Claims Data (State Level - Weekly)\n",
    "> - **Texas Labor Market Information**:  \n",
    ">   - Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (State/County - Quarterly/Monthly)\n",
    ">      - Construction Employment (County - Quarterly/Monthly)\n",
    "> - **Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)**:  \n",
    ">   - Individual Assistance Housing Registrants Large Disasters (County - Per Storm)\n",
    "\n",
    "> ### 2. Explore/Analyze the Data\n",
    "> ![image](materials/fig2.png)\n",
    "> ![image](materials/fig1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "> ### 3. Model the Data\n",
    "> Our overall strategy was to compare the actual post-hurricane trajectory of economic indicators to a predicted trajectory of those indicators based on pre-hurricane data. In other words, what would the economy look like if that hurricane never happened?\n",
    ">\n",
    "> We used the difference between the predicted values and the actual values to quantify the effect of the hurricane on those indicators.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> We chose a seasonal ARIMA model to forecast the hypothetical values of our economic indicators. We modeled: \n",
    "> - Weekly unemployment insurance initial claims (statewide)\n",
    "> - Monthly employment in the construction industry (by county)\n",
    ">    - We modeled on the three counties with the highest dollar amount in damage for each hurricane\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ![image](materials/fig3.png)\n",
    "> ![image](materials/fig4.png)\n",
    "> ![image](materials/fig5.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "> ### 4. Make Conclusions/Give Recommendations\n",
    "> **Practical Implications**\n",
    "> - National government programs/actions:\n",
    ">    - Fallout and disbursement of funds for hazard and flood mitigation\n",
    ">    - Areas of focus for government programs (i.e. employment)\n",
    ">    - Predictive budget allocation to areas that will be impacted more heavily\n",
    "> - Texas-specific actions:\n",
    ">    - Using the unemployment data that we have, use the model as a basis to prepare for possible employment displacement  during future hurricanes\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Limitations**\n",
    "> - Data\n",
    ">   - Empirical evidence of difficulty in data scraping\n",
    ">   - Granularity (annual vs monthly vs weekly)\n",
    ">   - Housing (Zillow)\n",
    "> - Economic Measures\n",
    ">   - No aggregate way to indicate “economic loss”\n",
    "> - Limited in scope\n",
    ">   - Looking at unemployment, employment, and wages does not begin to cover the entirety of economic factors impacted by a disaster\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Next Steps**\n",
    "> - Formulate an economic loss indicator to more accurately and holistically measure economic loss (economics degree?)\n",
    "> - Time-series model tuning\n",
    ">   - Hyperparameters (naive)\n",
    ">   - Seasonality component (P,D,Q)\n",
    "> - County data aggregation method\n",
    ">   - Find a way to aggregate economic measures (i.e. weighted system) to target just the counties that were heavily affected by a specific disaster\n",
    "> - Investigate different regions / different disasters\n",
